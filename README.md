# The GitHub History of the Scala language
Scala is a mature programming language with almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open-source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

In this project, I read in, cleaned up, and visualized the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub). I find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
